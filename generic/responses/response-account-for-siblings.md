While it isn't against our community rules to share the same computer, it would be best if your sibling made their account on their own machine. If it isn't possible, they may create their account on yours (not you for them!), but be extremely vigilant not to play on each other's account and to properly log out once you're done playing. As long as you keep your own accounts to yourselves, you'll be fine!
