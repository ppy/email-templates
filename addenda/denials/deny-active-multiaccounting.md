Sorry, but we have no choice but to decline your appeal at the present time. You have been found to be playing on several accounts still, which constitutes a violation of our [community rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Rules). We cannot allow you back into the game if you are still actively breaking the rules while appealing.

This resets your account's appeal cooldown back to three months from the date you receive this e-mail. Please make sure you cease accessing any accounts other than your main from this point on.
