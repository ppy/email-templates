Under certain circumstances, it's possible for a player to lose pp after setting a new score.

This happens typically when they achieve a high-accuracy play on a map, then overwrite that play but with significantly lower accuracy and higher combo. The newer play, with lower accuracy, would be considered less good and grant less pp. As we currently only support having one score per mod combination, the older play is lost and cannot be recovered.

We are planning on adding support for multiple recorded scores per mod combination to prevent this issue. Unfortunately, for now, you'll need to try and best your newer play with an even better one!
