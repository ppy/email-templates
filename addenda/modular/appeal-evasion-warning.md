Keep in mind that creating or accessing any accounts other than your main one (including restricted accounts) will be regarded as ban evasion and will result in your future appeals being denied.

If you are unsure which account you should be playing on, please reply to this e-mail. We'll tell you which one we consider your main, and help restore access to it if you have trouble logging into it.
