The issue might be that you're trying to use the OpenGL renderer without having a framerate limiter applied, or you don't have the drivers for your graphics card installed. This causes the game to freeze up on some system configurations.

To resolve your issue please do the following:
Hold the (left) SHIFT button while starting osu! and keep holding it untill a configuration window pops up.
Change your renderer to 'DirectX' in there and then click the 'start osu!' button.
If this setting isn't visible but you do have a setting to enable 'compatibility mode', enable this instead.

If you're still experiencing the issue try updating your graphics drivers. You can find more information about that [here](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Guides/GL_Support_Issues).
