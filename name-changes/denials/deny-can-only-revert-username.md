Sorry, but we cannot offer you this change. Your direct previous username is not the one you've requested, and we can only revert one direct change. You'll have to make that change yourself [on the store page](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/product/32).

Please refer to [this article](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Help_Center#is-it-possible-to-change-my-name-back-or-revert-to-my-old-username) for more information.
