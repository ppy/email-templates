Receiving a password reset request does not mean that your account has been broken into, as it can be sent from the [password recovery page](http://osu.ppy.sh/p/forgot) (this will redirect you to the settings if you are logged in).

It means that someone visited this page and entered either your username or your account's e-mail address trying to recover access to their account.

It's possible that the user mistyped their e-mail address or username, or is trying to get access to an account that held a username you've changed to. While receiving one such e-mail is not source of worry, keep an eye out for them. If they continue coming regularly, or several times in a single day, we'd recommend letting us know, and making sure your e-mail inbox is secure.
