Sorry, another user has claimed your previous username and we cannot proceed to the revert. If the user becomes inactive enough, please send us a new mail so that we can make the change for you. You can check when a username becomes available by going on [the store](https://osu.ppy.sh/store/products/32) and typing the username you want (without adding the change to your cart!), or you can read [name availaibility rules](https://osu.ppy.sh/help/wiki/Help_Center#can-i-take-another-player's-username?).
