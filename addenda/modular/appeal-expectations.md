What we expect from appeals is as follows:

- a full, honest history of your account, including any rulebreaking activities.
- explanations as to how you came to decide to break our rules.
- if applicable, explanations as to how and where you obtained the means to do so.
- reasons why we should allow you back into the game and why you won't be repeating your misbehaviour.
